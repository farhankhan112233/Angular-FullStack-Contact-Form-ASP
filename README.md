Project Overview
This project is a CRUD application where users can submit their personal information through a form, save it, view their records, edit them, or delete them.

I have also implemented JWT authentication in the .NET Core backend, allowing only admin users to delete records.

The backend is stored in a separate repository: CRUD-ASP.NET-core-Web-API-with-SQLserver-Angular-20-.
It uses the Code-First Approach with SQL Server for database management.

Note: The CSS design is not originally mine — I reused an existing stylesheet — but all other backend and frontend logic has been implemented by me from scratch.
